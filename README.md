# U!Scientist Exhibit Display

This is a quickly spun up React Native app to show some information about Galaxy Zoo
and U!Scientist for the touch table exhibit at the Adler.

The app is built for a 12.9" iPad. Any other size will require some modification
to the code. We are using ad hoc distribution on Xcode to distribute the app to a single
device.
